      <p className="mb-3">
  After earning my <span className="font-bold">BSc IT</span> from Mahendra Pratap Sharada Prasad Singh College, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey by founding my own clothing brand, Abres Store, while pursuing my <span className="font-bold">MCA</span> at LATE BHAUSAHEB HIRAY S.S. Trust’s Institute of Computer Application to further my passion for programming. I've developed a strong foundation in <span className="font-bold">full-stack web development</span>, with expertise in <span className="font-bold">React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB</span>. <span className="italic">What excites me most</span> about programming is solving complex problems and the fulfillment of finding solutions. I'm proficient in <span className="font-bold">TypeScript and Prisma</span> and always eager to explore new technologies. 
  As a <span className="font-bold">co-founder and full-stack developer of Abres Store</span>, I lead our efforts in trading both online and offline, distributing our products all over India. Currently, I am seeking a <span className="font-bold">full-time software developer role</span> where I can grow and contribute.
</p>

<p>
  <span className="italic">Outside of coding</span>, I'm driven to grow both <span className="font-bold">personally and professionally</span>. Whether it's staying updated on tech trends or solving creative problems with others, I’m always looking to <span className="font-bold">improve</span>. 
  My motto is simple—<span className="font-bold">always be learning, always be growing</span>.
